# Machine Learning Speech Recognition

Speech Recognition Kaggle competition - Tilburg University

The goal of this small machine learning challenge is to find the best learning algorithm and featuring engineering techniques to recognize the words pronounced in each audio recording. It is part of a Kaggle competition in which we only had 7 trials on the test set to evaluate the generalization power of our solution. We tried different approaches but Neural Networks ended up being the one that worked best. For this project I worked in a team with Maria Soares Eira and András Ádám.
